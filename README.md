   ## Functionalities:

    API access, with fetch(url) and map;

    Using useState and useEffect Hooks to make the paragraph with the tour info interactive, with Read More/Show Less button, and eliminating items from the page through     a button, in addition to a refresh button, in case there are no more items on the page, which updates to the initial value.


   ## Changes regarding the course design:

    Two new css variables were created, and used in some elements of the site.
